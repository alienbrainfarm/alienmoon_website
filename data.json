  "about": "<em>Alien Moon</em> is a psychedelic rock band from the Netherlands built for one purpose: getting people on the dance floor and keeping them there. Swirling guitars, hypnotic grooves, and cosmic energy collide in a live experience that blurs the line between a rock concert and a full-on dance party.<br><br>Drawing from the rich tradition of late-60s and 70s psychedelia — think fuzz-soaked riffs, expansive jams, and pulsing rhythm sections — Alien Moon crafts a sound that's <em>ancient and futuristic</em> at the same time. Every set is a trip. Come prepared to move.<br><br>(Side note: catch the band's alter ego <em>Crazy Cow</em> for their Neil Young tribute shows — a completely different beast, equally worth your evening.)",
